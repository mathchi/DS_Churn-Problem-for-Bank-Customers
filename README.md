# Churn-for-Bank-Customers
Predict customer churn in a bank


### Content


   - RowNumber—corresponds to the record (row) number and has no effect on the output. 
   - CustomerId—contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank. 
   - Surname—the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank. 
   - CreditScore—can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.
   - Geography—a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank. 
   - Gender—it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank. 
   - Age—this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.
   - Tenure—refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.
    - Balance—also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.
    - NumOfProducts—refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.
    - HasCrCard—denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.
    - IsActiveMember—active customers are less likely to leave the bank.
    - EstimatedSalary—as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.
    - Exited—whether or not the customer left the bank.



### Acknowledgements

As we know, it is much more expensive to sign in a new client than keeping an existing one.

It is advantageous for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company.

Churn prevention allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.
